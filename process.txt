Work Flow:


* Search "chef a domicle" on google
* Extract all urls in the page
* Verify if they have the word "translate" or "english", "translation", or "Thesaurus"
* Skip if they do, because it is a dictionary website we don't need
* Open all links that passed Step 3 test
* Scan through the pages for email and/or number
* If we find, we extract it, attach the site's name and URL then save
* After a page is completed we click on the next button
* And start again from Step 2
